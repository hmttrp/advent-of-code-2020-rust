> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
> -- Eric Wastl

This year I am trying to solve the puzzles in Rust. My solutions will not be the best at all times as I am just learning the language but I will try to improve them over time.
